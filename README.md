#### Abstract: 
Active fingerprinting is an effective way to know the security status of individual hosts and network as a whole. The fingerprint of a host is comprised of its route from the server, port status, OS and open services. Fingerprint gives a fair idea about the vulnerability of hosts against security threats. In this work, the output of fingerprint scanning tool has been analyzed extensively to determine correlations between various timers like RTTm, SRTT, RTTVar and RTO, and fingerprint components. Inter-component relations have also been explored to find out dependencies. The behavior of the hosts is analyzed during the course of the day. We analyzed the variability in timers within a network using active fingerprinting techniques.  It has been concluded that during low-traffic hours, timers are highly correlated while in high-traffic hours RTTm and RTO are not correlated with SRTT and RTTVar. Timers in a network vary widely whereas SRTT and RTTVar remain highly correlated throughout the analysis. Moreover, a distinct correlation pattern is observed in timers with variation in IP-ID Sequence classes, traceroute protocols and network traffic intensity.
